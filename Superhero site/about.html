        <h2><b>About Me:</b></h2>
        <p>I am a biochemistry and botany major student. I'm an undergrad student who's studies were interrupted for this year due
        to loss of financial support from NSFAS, however I am using this major setback not only to explore myself and 
        what I find important, but also to learn new skills, one of which is coding. It has helped me to expand my roster,
        to explore passions and notably improved my writing and perspective in my free time. In my free time, I write, listen 
        to music and engage in literature. Hoping to learn a lot with FNB App Academy :).</p>
